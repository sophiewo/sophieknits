<h2 align="center"> A series of knitting tools for budding or seasoned knitwear designers. </h2>

<h3 align="center"> Built with the mission to make creating patterns quicker and easier, with less head scratching... </h3>
  <h3 align="center"> ....so we can just get back to our knitting! </h3>

For those who aren't familar with knitwear design. There is a lot of simple(ish) arithmetic to do if you are working on a new pattern, trust me, you should see my notebook. 

Fed up of having to remember the equation for each different calculation I needed, I thought... ***"I know, I'm a dev, I'll just build them, so I and (you) don't have to do the maths*** so without further a do here we are:

## Tools: 

### Decrease Calculator

Calculate how to decrease stitches given a starting number and a desired stitch count

### Increase Calculator

Calculate how to increase stitches given a starting number and a desired stitch count

### Sleeve Decrease Calculator

Calculate the decrease needed across a specified series of rows to acheive a tapered sleeve"

## Progress so far:

- **Basic webpage layout:** navbar, page layout and some intial styling
- **Social Links**
- **Decrease Calculator:** has basic functionality, some tests written, edge cases need to be tested, component needs refactoring

## Tech

This project has been built with React bootstrapped from `create-react-app` 
#### To run the app in development mode:
